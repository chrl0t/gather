# Gather

Gather is a mobile foraging app which i'm currently building using React Native designed to help users find out what's in season, where to find it, and see recipe ideas.

I am using 'The Urban Forager' by Hoxton Mini Press for foraging info, and the Edamam Recipe API for suggested recipes.
